# BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin for ADK

Supported in ADKPython v1.21.0Preview

Version Requirement

Use ADK Python version 1.26.0 or higher to make full use of the features described in this document, including auto-schema-upgrade, tool provenance tracking, and HITL event tracing.

The BigQuery Agent Analytics Plugin significantly enhances the Agent Development Kit (ADK) by providing a robust solution for in-depth agent behavior analysis. Using the ADK Plugin architecture and the **BigQuery Storage Write API**, it captures and logs critical operational events directly into a Google BigQuery table, empowering you with advanced capabilities for debugging, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive offline performance evaluation.

Version 1.26.0 adds **Auto Schema Upgrade** (safely add new columns to existing tables), **Tool Provenance** tracking (LOCAL, MCP, SUB_AGENT, A2A, TRANSFER_AGENT), and **HITL Event Tracing** for human-in-the-loop interactions. Version 1.27.0 adds **Automatic View Creation** (generate flat, query-friendly event views).

Preview release

The BigQuery Agent Analytics Plugin is in Preview release. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).

BigQuery Storage Write API

This feature uses **BigQuery Storage Write API**, which is a paid service. For information on costs, see the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing?e=48754805&hl=en#data-ingestion-pricing).

## Use cases

- **Agent workflow debugging and analysis:** Capture a wide range of *plugin lifecycle events* (LLM calls, tool usage) and *agent-yielded events* (user input, model responses), into a well-defined schema.
- **High-volume analysis and debugging:** Logging operations are performed asynchronously using the Storage Write API to allow high throughput and low latency.
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Log and analyze text, images, and other modalities. Large files are offloaded to GCS, making them accessible to BigQuery ML via Object Tables.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Built-in support for OpenTelemetry-style tracing (`trace_id`, `span_id`) to visualize agent execution flows.
- **Tool Provenance**: Track the origin of each tool call (local function, MCP server, sub-agent, A2A remote agent, or transfer agent).
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Tracing**: Dedicated event types for credential requests, confirmation prompts, and user input requests.
- **Queryable Event Views**: Automatically create flat, per-event-type BigQuery views (e.g., `v_llm_request`, `v_tool_completed`) to simplify downstream analytics by unnesting JSON payload data.

The agent event data recorded varies based on the ADK event type. For more information, see [Event types and payloads](#event-types).

## Prerequisites

- **Google Cloud Project** with the **BigQuery API** enabled.
- **BigQuery Dataset:** Create a dataset to store logging tables before using the plugin. The plugin automatically creates the necessary events table within the dataset if the table does not exist.
- **Google Cloud Storage Bucket (Optional):** If you plan to log multimodal content (images, audio, etc.), creating a GCS bucket is recommended for offloading large files.
- **Authentication:**
  - **Local:** Run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
  - **Cloud:** Ensure your service account has the required permissions.

Note: Gemini model selector `gemini-flash-latest`

Most code examples in ADK documentation use `gemini-flash-latest` to select the [latest available](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#latest) Gemini Flash version. However, if you access Gemini from a regional endpoint, such as `us-central1`, this selection string may not work. In that case, use a specific model version string from the [Gemini models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) page or Google Cloud [Gemini models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models) list.

### IAM permissions

For the agent to work properly, the principal (e.g., service account, user account) under which the agent is running needs these Google Cloud roles: * `roles/bigquery.jobUser` at Project Level to run BigQuery queries. * `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` at Table Level to write log/event data. * **If using GCS offloading:** `roles/storage.objectCreator` and `roles/storage.objectViewer` on the target bucket.

## Use with agent

You use the BigQuery Agent Analytics Plugin by configuring and registering it with your ADK agent's App object. The following example shows an implementation of an agent with this plugin, including GCS offloading:

my_bq_agent/agent.py

```python
# my_bq_agent/agent.py
import os
import google.auth
from google.adk.apps import App
from google.adk.plugins.bigquery_agent_analytics_plugin import BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin, BigQueryLoggerConfig
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig


# --- OpenTelemetry TracerProvider Setup (Optional) ---
# ADK includes OpenTelemetry as a core dependency.
# Configuring a TracerProvider enables full distributed tracing
# (populates trace_id, span_id with standard OTel identifiers).
# If no TracerProvider is configured, the plugin falls back to internal
# UUIDs for span correlation while still preserving the parent-child hierarchy.
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
trace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())

# --- Configuration ---
PROJECT_ID = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT", "your-gcp-project-id")
DATASET_ID = os.environ.get("BIG_QUERY_DATASET_ID", "your-big-query-dataset-id")
# GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION must be a valid Vertex AI region (e.g., "us-central1").
# BQ_LOCATION is the BigQuery dataset location, which can be a multi-region
# like "US" or "EU", or a single region like "us-central1".
VERTEX_LOCATION = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION", "us-central1")
BQ_LOCATION = os.environ.get("BQ_LOCATION", "US")
GCS_BUCKET = os.environ.get("GCS_BUCKET_NAME", "your-gcs-bucket-name") # Optional

if PROJECT_ID == "your-gcp-project-id":
    raise ValueError("Please set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT or update the code.")

# --- CRITICAL: Set environment variables BEFORE Gemini instantiation ---
os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT'] = PROJECT_ID
os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION'] = VERTEX_LOCATION
os.environ['GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI'] = 'True'

# --- Initialize the Plugin with Config ---
bq_config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    enabled=True,
    gcs_bucket_name=GCS_BUCKET, # Enable GCS offloading for multimodal content
    log_multi_modal_content=True,
    max_content_length=500 * 1024, # 500 KB limit for inline text
    batch_size=1, # Default is 1 for low latency, increase for high throughput
    shutdown_timeout=10.0
)

bq_logging_plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    table_id="agent_events", # default table name is agent_events
    config=bq_config,
    location=BQ_LOCATION
)

# --- Initialize Tools and Model ---
credentials, _ = google.auth.default(scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"])
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(
    credentials_config=BigQueryCredentialsConfig(credentials=credentials)
)

llm = Gemini(model="gemini-flash-latest")

root_agent = Agent(
    model=llm,
    name='my_bq_agent',
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant with access to BigQuery tools.",
    tools=[bigquery_toolset]
)

# --- Create the App ---
app = App(
    name="my_bq_agent",
    root_agent=root_agent,
    plugins=[bq_logging_plugin],
)
```

### Run and test agent

Test the plugin by running the agent and making a few requests through the chat interface, such as "tell me what you can do" or "List datasets in my cloud project ". These actions create events which are recorded in your Google Cloud project BigQuery instance. Once these events have been processed, you can view the data for them in the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery), using this query

```sql
SELECT timestamp, event_type, content
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-big-query-dataset-id.agent_events`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Deploy to Agent Engine with the plugin

You can deploy an agent with the BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin to [Vertex AI Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview). This section walks through the steps to deploy using the ADK CLI, and alternatively using the Vertex AI SDK programmatically.

Version Requirement

Use ADK Python version **1.24.0 or higher** to deploy with this plugin to Agent Engine. Earlier versions had an issue where the plugin's asynchronous log writer could be terminated by the serverless runtime before flushing pending events. Starting from 1.24.0, the plugin performs a synchronous flush at the end of each invocation to ensure all events are written.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have completed the general [Agent Engine setup](/deploy/agent-engine/deploy/#setup-cloud-project), including:

1. A Google Cloud project with the **Vertex AI API** and **Cloud Resource Manager API** enabled.
1. A **BigQuery dataset** in the target project (or a cross-project dataset with the correct permissions).
1. A **Cloud Storage staging bucket** for deployment artifacts.
1. The deploying service account has the IAM roles listed in [IAM permissions](#iam-permissions).
1. Your coding environment is [authenticated](/deploy/agent-engine/deploy/#prerequisites-coding-env) with `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`.

### Step 1: Define the agent and plugin

Create your agent project folder with an `App` object that includes the plugin. The `App` object is required for Agent Engine deployments with plugins.

```text
my_bq_agent/
├── __init__.py
├── agent.py
└── requirements.txt
```

my_bq_agent/__init__.py

```python
from . import agent
```

my_bq_agent/agent.py

```python
import os
import google.auth
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.apps import App
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.plugins.bigquery_agent_analytics_plugin import (
    BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin,
    BigQueryLoggerConfig,
)
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# --- Configuration ---
PROJECT_ID = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT", "your-gcp-project-id")
DATASET_ID = os.environ.get("BQ_DATASET", "agent_analytics")
# BQ_LOCATION is the BigQuery dataset location (multi-region "US"/"EU" or
# a single region like "us-central1"). This is separate from the Vertex AI
# region used by GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION.
BQ_LOCATION = os.environ.get("BQ_LOCATION", "US")

os.environ["GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI"] = "True"

# --- Plugin ---
bq_analytics_plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    location=BQ_LOCATION,
    config=BigQueryLoggerConfig(
        batch_size=1,
        batch_flush_interval=0.5,
        log_session_metadata=True,
    ),
)

# --- Tools ---
credentials, _ = google.auth.default(
    scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"]
)
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(
    credentials_config=BigQueryCredentialsConfig(credentials=credentials)
)

# --- Agent ---
root_agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-flash-latest"),
    name="my_bq_agent",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant with access to BigQuery tools.",
    tools=[bigquery_toolset],
)

# --- App (required for Agent Engine with plugins) ---
app = App(
    name="my_bq_agent",
    root_agent=root_agent,
    plugins=[bq_analytics_plugin],
)
```

my_bq_agent/requirements.txt

```text
google-adk[bigquery]
google-cloud-bigquery-storage
pyarrow
opentelemetry-api
opentelemetry-sdk
```

### Step 2: Deploy using ADK CLI

Use the `adk deploy agent_engine` command to deploy the agent. The `--adk_app` flag tells the CLI which `App` object to use:

```shell
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
LOCATION=us-central1

adk deploy agent_engine \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID \
    --region=$LOCATION \
    --staging_bucket=gs://your-staging-bucket \
    --display_name="My BQ Analytics Agent" \
    --adk_app=agent.app \
    my_bq_agent
```

`--adk_app` flag

The `--adk_app` flag specifies the module path and variable name of the `App` object (in the format `module.variable`). In this example, `agent.app` refers to the `app` variable in `agent.py`. This ensures the deployment correctly picks up the plugin configuration.

Once successfully deployed, you should see output like:

```shell
AgentEngine created. Resource name: projects/123456789/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/751619551677906944
```

Note the **Resource name** for the next step.

### Step 3: Test the deployed agent

After deployment, you can query the agent using the Vertex AI SDK:

test_deployed_agent.py

```python
import uuid
import vertexai

PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
AGENT_ID = "751619551677906944"  # from deployment output

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
client = vertexai.Client(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

agent = client.agent_engines.get(
    name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/reasoningEngines/{AGENT_ID}"
)

user_id = f"test_user_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
for chunk in agent.stream_query(
    message="List datasets in my project", user_id=user_id
):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

### Step 4: Verify events in BigQuery

After sending a few queries to the deployed agent, verify that events are being logged by querying your BigQuery table:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, event_type, agent, content
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.agent_analytics.agent_events`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

You should see events such as `INVOCATION_STARTING`, `LLM_REQUEST`, `LLM_RESPONSE`, `TOOL_STARTING`, `TOOL_COMPLETED`, and `INVOCATION_COMPLETED`.

### Alternative: Deploy using the Vertex AI SDK

You can also deploy programmatically using the Vertex AI SDK directly. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines or custom deployment workflows:

deploy.py

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai import agent_engines
from my_bq_agent.agent import app

PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
STAGING_BUCKET = "gs://your-staging-bucket"

vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION, staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET
)
client = vertexai.Client(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

remote_app = client.agent_engines.create(
    agent=app,
    config={
        "display_name": "My BQ Analytics Agent",
        "staging_bucket": STAGING_BUCKET,
        "requirements": [
            "google-adk[bigquery]",
            "google-cloud-aiplatform[agent_engines]",
            "google-cloud-bigquery-storage",
            "pyarrow",
            "opentelemetry-api",
            "opentelemetry-sdk",
        ],
    },
)
print(f"Deployed agent: {remote_app.api_resource.name}")
```

### Troubleshooting

If events are not appearing in your BigQuery table after deployment:

1. **Check ADK version**: Ensure `google-adk>=1.24.0` is in your requirements. Earlier versions do not flush pending events before the serverless runtime suspends the process.

1. **Enable debug logging**: Add the following to the top of your `agent.py` to surface any silent errors:

   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logging.getLogger("google_adk").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```

1. **Check IAM permissions**: The Agent Engine service account needs `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` on the target table and `roles/bigquery.jobUser` on the project. For **cross-project** logging, also ensure the BigQuery API is enabled in the source project and the service account has `bigquery.tables.updateData` on the destination table.

1. **Verify plugin initialization**: In Cloud Logging, filter by `resource.type="reasoning_engine"` and look for plugin startup messages or error logs.

1. **Use immediate flush for debugging**: Set `batch_size=1` and `batch_flush_interval=0.1` in `BigQueryLoggerConfig` to rule out buffering issues.

## Tracing and Observability

The plugin supports **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing. OpenTelemetry is included as a core dependency of ADK and is always available.

- **Automatic Span Management**: The plugin automatically generates spans for Agent execution, LLM calls, and Tool executions.
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: If a `TracerProvider` is configured (as shown in the example above), the plugin will use valid OTel spans, populating `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `parent_span_id` with standard OTel identifiers. This allows you to correlate agent logs with other services in your distributed system.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: If no `TracerProvider` is configured (i.e., only the default no-op provider is active), the plugin automatically falls back to generating internal UUIDs for spans and uses the `invocation_id` as the trace ID. This ensures that the parent-child hierarchy (Agent -> Span -> Tool/LLM) is *always* preserved in the BigQuery logs, even without a configured `TracerProvider`.

## Configuration options

You can customize the plugin using `BigQueryLoggerConfig`.

- **`enabled`** (`bool`, default: `True`): To disable the plugin from logging agent data to the BigQuery table, set this parameter to False.
- **`table_id`** (`str`, default: `"agent_events"`): The BigQuery table ID within the dataset. Can also be overridden by the `table_id` parameter on the `BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin` constructor, which takes precedence.
- **`clustering_fields`** (`List[str]`, default: `["event_type", "agent", "user_id"]`): The fields used to cluster the BigQuery table when it is automatically created.
- **`gcs_bucket_name`** (`Optional[str]`, default: `None`): The name of the GCS bucket to offload large content (images, blobs, large text) to. If not provided, large content may be truncated or replaced with placeholders.
- **`connection_id`** (`Optional[str]`, default: `None`): The BigQuery connection ID (e.g., `us.my-connection`) to use as the authorizer for `ObjectRef` columns. Required for using `ObjectRef` with BigQuery ML.
- **`max_content_length`** (`int`, default: `500 * 1024`): The maximum length (in characters) of text content to store **inline** in BigQuery before offloading to GCS (if configured) or truncating. Default is 500 KB.
- **`batch_size`** (`int`, default: `1`): The number of events to batch before writing to BigQuery.
- **`batch_flush_interval`** (`float`, default: `1.0`): The maximum time (in seconds) to wait before flushing a partial batch.
- **`shutdown_timeout`** (`float`, default: `10.0`): Seconds to wait for logs to flush during shutdown.
- **`event_allowlist`** (`Optional[List[str]]`, default: `None`): A list of event types to log. If `None`, all events are logged except those in `event_denylist`. For a comprehensive list of supported event types, refer to the [Event types and payloads](#event-types) section.
- **`event_denylist`** (`Optional[List[str]]`, default: `None`): A list of event types to skip logging. For a comprehensive list of supported event types, refer to the [Event types and payloads](#event-types) section.
- **`content_formatter`** (`Optional[Callable[[Any, str], Any]]`, default: `None`): An optional function to format event content before logging. The function receives two arguments: the raw content and the event type string (e.g., `"LLM_REQUEST"`).
- **`log_multi_modal_content`** (`bool`, default: `True`): Whether to log detailed content parts (including GCS references).
- **`queue_max_size`** (`int`, default: `10000`): The maximum number of events to hold in the in-memory queue before dropping new events.
- **`retry_config`** (`RetryConfig`, default: `RetryConfig()`): Configuration for retrying failed BigQuery writes (attributes: `max_retries`, `initial_delay`, `multiplier`, `max_delay`).
- **`log_session_metadata`** (`bool`, default: `True`): If True, logs session information into the `attributes` column, including `session_id`, `app_name`, `user_id`, and the session `state` dictionary (e.g., custom state like gchat thread-id, customer_id).
- **`custom_tags`** (`Dict[str, Any]`, default: `{}`): A dictionary of static tags (e.g., `{"env": "prod", "version": "1.0"}`) to be included in the `attributes` column for every event.
- **`auto_schema_upgrade`** (`bool`, default: `True`): When enabled, the plugin automatically adds new columns to an existing table when the plugin schema evolves. Only additive changes are made (columns are never dropped or altered). A version label (`adk_schema_version`) on the table ensures the diff runs at most once per schema version. Safe to leave enabled.
- **`create_views`** (`bool`, default: `True`): Added in 1.27.0. When enabled, automatically generates per-event-type BigQuery views that unnest structured JSON data (such as `content` or `attributes`) into flat, typed columns, significantly simplifying SQL queries.

The following code sample shows how to define a configuration for the BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin:

```python
import json
import re

from google.adk.plugins.bigquery_agent_analytics_plugin import BigQueryLoggerConfig

def redact_dollar_amounts(event_content: Any, event_type: str) -> str:
    """
    Custom formatter to redact dollar amounts (e.g., $600, $12.50)
    and ensure JSON output if the input is a dict.

    Args:
        event_content: The raw content of the event.
        event_type: The event type string (e.g., "LLM_REQUEST", "LLM_RESPONSE").
    """
    text_content = ""
    if isinstance(event_content, dict):
        text_content = json.dumps(event_content)
    else:
        text_content = str(event_content)

    # Regex to find dollar amounts: $ followed by digits, optionally with commas or decimals.
    # Examples: $600, $1,200.50, $0.99
    redacted_content = re.sub(r'\$\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d+)?', 'xxx', text_content)

    return redacted_content

config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    enabled=True,
    event_allowlist=["LLM_REQUEST", "LLM_RESPONSE"], # Only log these events
    # event_denylist=["TOOL_STARTING"], # Skip these events
    shutdown_timeout=10.0, # Wait up to 10s for logs to flush on exit
    max_content_length=500, # Truncate content to 500 chars
    content_formatter=redact_dollar_amounts, # Redact the dollar amounts in the logging content
    queue_max_size=10000, # Max events to hold in memory
    auto_schema_upgrade=True, # Automatically add new columns to existing tables
    create_views=True, # Automatically create per-event-type views
    # retry_config=RetryConfig(max_retries=3), # Optional: Configure retries
)

plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(..., config=config)
```

## Schema and production setup

### Schema Reference

The events table (`agent_events`) uses a flexible schema. The following table provides a comprehensive reference with example values.

| Field Name         | Type        | Mode       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Example Value                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **timestamp**      | `TIMESTAMP` | `REQUIRED` | UTC timestamp of event creation. Acts as the primary ordering key and the daily partitioning key. Precision is microsecond.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | `2026-02-03 20:52:17 UTC`                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The plugin automatically creates the table if it does not exist. However, for production, we recommend creating the table manually using the following DDL, which utilizes the **JSON** type for flexibility and **REPEATED RECORD**s for multimodal content.

**Recommended DDL:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE `your-gcp-project-id.adk_agent_logs.agent_events`
(
  timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL OPTIONS(description="The UTC time at which the event was logged."),
  event_type STRING OPTIONS(description="Indicates the type of event being logged (e.g., 'LLM_REQUEST', 'TOOL_COMPLETED')."),
  agent STRING OPTIONS(description="The name of the ADK agent or author associated with the event."),
  session_id STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier to group events within a single conversation or user session."),
  invocation_id STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier for each individual agent execution or turn within a session."),
  user_id STRING OPTIONS(description="The identifier of the user associated with the current session."),
  trace_id STRING OPTIONS(description="OpenTelemetry trace ID for distributed tracing."),
  span_id STRING OPTIONS(description="OpenTelemetry span ID for this specific operation."),
  parent_span_id STRING OPTIONS(description="OpenTelemetry parent span ID to reconstruct hierarchy."),

  latency_ms JSON OPTIONS(description="Latency measurements (e.g., total_ms)."),
  status STRING OPTIONS(description="The outcome of the event, typically 'OK' or 'ERROR'."),

### Automatically Created Views (1.27.0+)

When `create_views=True` (the default in 1.27.0 and higher), the plugin automatically generates views for each event type that unnest common JSON structures into flat, typed columns. This significantly simplifies SQL, eliminating the need to write complex `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_QUERY` functions explicitly.

For example, the view `v_llm_request` includes the following schema:

| Field Name           | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Event types and payloads

The `content` column now contains a **JSON** object specific to the `event_type`. The `content_parts` column provides a structured view of the content, especially useful for images or offloaded data.

Content Truncation

- Variable content fields are truncated to `max_content_length` (configured in `BigQueryLoggerConfig`, default 500KB).
- If `gcs_bucket_name` is configured, large content is offloaded to GCS instead of being truncated, and a reference is stored in `content_parts.object_ref`.

#### LLM interactions (plugin lifecycle)

These events track the raw requests sent to and responses received from the LLM.

**1. LLM_REQUEST**

Captures the prompt sent to the model, including conversation history and system instructions.

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_REQUEST",
  "content": {
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
    "prompt": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "hello how are you today"
      }
    ]
  },
  "attributes": {
    "root_agent_name": "my_bq_agent",
    "model": "gemini-flash-latest",
    "tools": ["list_dataset_ids", "execute_sql"],
    "llm_config": {
      "temperature": 0.5,
      "top_p": 0.9
    }
  }
}
```

**2. LLM_RESPONSE**

Captures the model's output and token usage statistics.

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_RESPONSE",
  "content": {
    "response": "text: 'Hello! I'm doing well...'",
    "usage": {
      "completion": 19,
      "prompt": 10129,
      "total": 10148
    }
  },
  "attributes": {
    "root_agent_name": "my_bq_agent",
    "model_version": "gemini-flash-latest",
    "usage_metadata": {
      "prompt_token_count": 10129,
      "candidates_token_count": 19,
      "total_token_count": 10148
    }
  },
  "latency_ms": {
    "time_to_first_token_ms": 2579,
    "total_ms": 2579
  }
}
```

**3. LLM_ERROR**

Logged when an LLM call fails with an exception. The error message is captured and the span is closed.

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_ERROR",
  "content": null,
  "attributes": {
    "root_agent_name": "my_bq_agent"
  },
  "error_message": "Error 429: Resource exhausted",
  "latency_ms": {
    "total_ms": 350
  }
}
```

#### Tool usage (plugin lifecycle)

These events track the execution of tools by the agent. Each tool event includes a `tool_origin` field that classifies the tool's provenance:

| Tool Origin      | Description                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOCAL`          | `FunctionTool` instances (local Python functions)  |
| `MCP`            | Model Context Protocol tools (`McpTool` instances) |
| `SUB_AGENT`      | `AgentTool` instances (sub-agents)                 |
| `A2A`            | Remote Agent-to-Agent instances (`RemoteA2aAgent`) |
| `TRANSFER_AGENT` | `TransferToAgentTool` instances                    |
| `UNKNOWN`        | Unclassified tools                                 |

**4. TOOL_STARTING**

Logged when an agent begins executing a tool.

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_STARTING",
  "content": {
    "tool": "list_dataset_ids",
    "args": {
      "project_id": "bigquery-public-data"
    },
    "tool_origin": "LOCAL"
  }
}
```

**5. TOOL_COMPLETED**

Logged when a tool execution finishes.

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_COMPLETED",
  "content": {
    "tool": "list_dataset_ids",
    "result": [
      "austin_311",
      "austin_bikeshare"
    ],
    "tool_origin": "LOCAL"
  },
  "latency_ms": {
    "total_ms": 467
  }
}
```

**6. TOOL_ERROR**

Logged when a tool execution fails with an exception. Captures the tool name, arguments, tool origin, and error message.

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_ERROR",
  "content": {
    "tool": "list_dataset_ids",
    "args": {
      "project_id": "nonexistent-project"
    },
    "tool_origin": "LOCAL"
  },
  "error_message": "Error 404: Dataset not found",
  "latency_ms": {
    "total_ms": 150
  }
}
```

#### State Management

These events track changes to the agent's state, typically triggered by tools.

**7. STATE_DELTA**

Tracks changes to the agent's internal state (e.g., token cache updates).

```json
{
  "event_type": "STATE_DELTA",
  "attributes": {
    "state_delta": {
      "bigquery_token_cache": "{\"token\": \"ya29...\", \"expiry\": \"...\"}"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Agent lifecycle & Generic Events

| **Event Type**          | **Content (JSON) Structure**                 |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `INVOCATION_STARTING`   | `{}`                                         |
| `INVOCATION_COMPLETED`  | `{}`                                         |
| `AGENT_STARTING`        | `"You are a helpful agent..."`               |
| `AGENT_COMPLETED`       | `{}`                                         |
| `USER_MESSAGE_RECEIVED` | `{"text_summary": "Help me book a flight."}` |

#### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Events

The plugin automatically detects calls to ADK's synthetic HITL tools and emits dedicated event types for them. These events are logged **in addition to** the normal `TOOL_STARTING` / `TOOL_COMPLETED` events.

The following HITL tool names are recognized:

- `adk_request_credential` — Request for user credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens)
- `adk_request_confirmation` — Request for user confirmation before proceeding
- `adk_request_input` — Request for free-form user input

| **Event Type**                        | **Trigger**                            | **Content (JSON) Structure**                            |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST`             | Agent calls `adk_request_credential`   | `{"tool": "adk_request_credential", "args": {...}}`     |
| `HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_COMPLETED`   | User provides credential response      | `{"tool": "adk_request_credential", "result": {...}}`   |
| `HITL_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST`           | Agent calls `adk_request_confirmation` | `{"tool": "adk_request_confirmation", "args": {...}}`   |
| `HITL_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST_COMPLETED` | User provides confirmation response    | `{"tool": "adk_request_confirmation", "result": {...}}` |
| `HITL_INPUT_REQUEST`                  | Agent calls `adk_request_input`        | `{"tool": "adk_request_input", "args": {...}}`          |
| `HITL_INPUT_REQUEST_COMPLETED`        | User provides input response           | `{"tool": "adk_request_input", "result": {...}}`        |

HITL request events are detected from `function_call` parts in `on_event_callback`. HITL completion events are detected from `function_response` parts in both `on_event_callback` and `on_user_message_callback`.

#### GCS Offloading Examples (Multimodal & Large Text)

When `gcs_bucket_name` is configured, large text and multimodal content (images, audio, etc.) are automatically offloaded to GCS. The `content` column will contain a summary or placeholder, while `content_parts` contains the `object_ref` pointing to the GCS URI.

**Offloaded Text Example**

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_REQUEST",
  "content_parts": [
    {
      "part_index": 1,
      "mime_type": "text/plain",
      "storage_mode": "GCS_REFERENCE",
      "text": "AAAA... [OFFLOADED]",
      "object_ref": {
        "uri": "gs://haiyuan-adk-debug-verification-1765319132/2025-12-10/e-f9545d6d/ae5235e6_p1.txt",
        "authorizer": "us.bqml_connection",
        "details": {"gcs_metadata": {"content_type": "text/plain"}}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Offloaded Image Example**

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_REQUEST",
  "content_parts": [
    {
      "part_index": 2,
      "mime_type": "image/png",
      "storage_mode": "GCS_REFERENCE",
      "text": "[MEDIA OFFLOADED]",
      "object_ref": {
        "uri": "gs://haiyuan-adk-debug-verification-1765319132/2025-12-10/e-f9545d6d/ae5235e6_p2.png",
        "authorizer": "us.bqml_connection",
        "details": {"gcs_metadata": {"content_type": "image/png"}}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

-- Find a recent failed session
SET failed_session_id = (
    SELECT session_id
    FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
    WHERE error_message IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Reconstruct the full conversation context
WITH SessionContext AS (
    SELECT
        session_id,
        STRING_AGG(CONCAT(event_type, ': ', COALESCE(TO_JSON_STRING(content), '')), '\n' ORDER BY timestamp) as full_history
    FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
    WHERE session_id = failed_session_id
    GROUP BY session_id
)
-- Ask Gemini to diagnose the issue
SELECT
    session_id,
    AI.GENERATE(
        ('Analyze this conversation log and explain the root cause of the failure. Log: ', full_history),
        endpoint => 'gemini-flash-latest'
    ).result AS root_cause_explanation
FROM SessionContext;
```

## Conversational Analytics in BigQuery

You can also use [BigQuery Conversational Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/conversational-analytics) to analyze your agent logs using natural language. Use this tool to answer questions like:

- "Show me the error rate over time"
- "What are the most common tool calls?"
- "Identify sessions with high token usage"

## Looker Studio Dashboard

You can visualize your agent's performance using our pre-built [Looker Studio Dashboard template](https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/reporting/f1c5b513-3095-44f8-90a2-54953d41b125/page/8YdhF).

To connect this dashboard to your own BigQuery table, use the following link format, replacing the placeholders with your specific project, dataset, and table IDs:

```text
https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/create?c.reportId=f1c5b513-3095-44f8-90a2-54953d41b125&ds.ds3.connector=bigQuery&ds.ds3.type=TABLE&ds.ds3.projectId=<your-project-id>&ds.ds3.datasetId=<your-dataset-id>&ds.ds3.tableId=<your-table-id>
```

## Security: Avoid logging sensitive credentials

Do not log OAuth tokens, API keys, or client secrets

The BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin captures detailed event payloads, including tool arguments, LLM prompts, and authentication-related events (such as HITL credential requests). If your agent uses **authenticated tools** (e.g., `AuthenticatedFunctionTool` with OAuth2), the plugin may log sensitive values such as `client_secret`, `access_token`, or API keys into the `content` column of your BigQuery table.

This is a known concern ([google/adk-python#3845](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/3845)) and can lead to credential exposure in your analytics data.

To prevent sensitive credentials from being persisted in BigQuery, use one or more of the following approaches:

### Use `content_formatter` to redact secrets

Provide a custom `content_formatter` function in `BigQueryLoggerConfig` to strip or mask sensitive fields before they are written:

```python
import json
import re
from typing import Any

SENSITIVE_KEYS = {"client_secret", "access_token", "refresh_token", "api_key", "secret"}

def redact_credentials(event_content: Any, event_type: str) -> str:
    """Redact OAuth secrets and tokens from logged content."""
    if isinstance(event_content, dict):
        text = json.dumps(event_content)
    else:
        text = str(event_content)

    for key in SENSITIVE_KEYS:
        # Redact values in JSON-like strings: "client_secret": "GOCSPX-xxx"
        text = re.sub(
            rf'("{key}"\s*:\s*)"[^"]*"',
            rf'\1"[REDACTED]"',
            text,
            flags=re.IGNORECASE,
        )
    return text

config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    content_formatter=redact_credentials,
    # ... other options
)
```

### Use `event_denylist` to skip credential events

If you do not need to log authentication-related events, exclude them entirely:

```python
config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    event_denylist=[
        "HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST",
        "HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_COMPLETED",
    ],
    # ... other options
)
```

### General best practices

- **Never hardcode secrets** in agent source code. Use environment variables or a secret manager (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager) for OAuth client secrets and API keys.
- **Restrict BigQuery table access** using IAM to limit who can read logged event data.
- **Audit your logs** periodically to verify no unexpected sensitive data is being captured.
