# StackOne plugin for ADK

Supported in ADKPython

The [StackOne ADK Plugin](https://github.com/StackOneHQ/stackone-adk-plugin) connects your ADK agent to hundreds of providers through [StackOne's](https://stackone.com) unified AI Integration gateway. Instead of manually defining tool functions for each API, this plugin dynamically discovers available tools from your connected providers and exposes them as native tools in ADK. It supports Human Resources Information Systems (HRIS), Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), productivity and scheduling tools, and many more [integrations](https://www.stackone.com/connectors).

## Use cases

- **Sales and Revenue Operations**: Build agents that find leads in your CRM (e.g. HubSpot, Salesforce), enrich contact data, draft personalized outreach, and log activity back — all within one conversation.
- **People Operations**: Create agents that screen candidates in your ATS (e.g. Greenhouse, Ashby), check availability in your calendar tool (e.g. Google Calendar, Calendly), collect interview scorecards, move applicants through pipeline stages, and automate onboarding into your HRIS (e.g. BambooHR, Workday) — covering the full employee lifecycle without manual intervention.
- **Marketing Automation**: Build campaign agents that sync audience segments from your CRM to your email platform (e.g. Mailchimp, Klaviyo), trigger email sequences, and report on engagement metrics across channels.
- **Product Delivery**: Create agents that triage incoming feedback from your support tools (e.g. Intercom, Zendesk, Slack), prioritize and create issues in your project management tool (e.g. Linear, Jira), and resolve incidents using insights from an observability platform (e.g. PagerDuty, Datadog) — uniting product research, delivery, and reliability in a single workflow.

## Prerequisites

- A [StackOne account](https://app.stackone.com) with at least one connected provider
- A StackOne API key from the [StackOne Dashboard](https://app.stackone.com)
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

## Installation

```bash
pip install stackone-adk
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv add stackone-adk
```

## Use with agent

Environment variables

Set your API keys as environment variables before running the examples below:

```bash
export STACKONE_API_KEY="your-stackone-api-key"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
```

Once `STACKONE_API_KEY` is set, the plugin automatically reads it and discovers your connected accounts.

```python

from google.adk.apps import App
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
from stackone_adk import StackOnePlugin


async def main():
    plugin = StackOnePlugin()
    # Or scope to a specific account:
    # plugin = StackOnePlugin(account_id="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID")

    tools = plugin.get_tools()
    print(f"Discovered {len(tools)} tools")

    agent = Agent(
        model="gemini-flash-latest",
        name="scheduling_agent",
        description="Manages scheduling, HR, and CRM through StackOne.",
        instruction=(

            "You help users manage their scheduling, HR, and CRM tasks "
            "by using the available tools.\n\n"
            "Always be helpful and provide clear, organized responses."
        ),
        tools=tools,
    )

    app = App(
        name="scheduling_app",
        root_agent=agent,

    async with InMemoryRunner(app=app) as runner:

## Available tools

Unlike integrations with a fixed set of tools, StackOne tools are **dynamically discovered** from your connected providers via the StackOne API. The available tools depend on which SaaS providers you have connected in your [StackOne Dashboard](https://app.stackone.com).

To list discovered tools:

```python
plugin = StackOnePlugin(account_id="YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID") # Optional: omit to use all connected accounts
for tool in plugin.get_tools():
    print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}")
```
